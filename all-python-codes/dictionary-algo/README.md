# Dictionary Algorithm 
We would not be explaining explicitly on this becase the codes are well commented for you to understand what it is all about.

- ## [Dictionary.py](https://github.com/chryzcodez/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/dictionary-algo/dictionary.py)
   This is the python code/algorithm that workes through getting and parsing a wordd to get it's specific defination.
- ## [Data.json](https://github.com/chryzcodez/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/dictionary-algo/data.json)
   This is the json file where words are stored, not complete as the words embedded in a real dictionary but it contains necessary, important and enough words and it's specific
   definations to act as a dictionary. You can view this file directly here on github because of how large it is. So, do well to download it on your machine.
