- [data.json](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/dictionary-algo/data.json)

This is a large json file, with lots of data. You can't view this here directly on github, so it is advisable you clone and download it on your machine.
This file contains a data in a json format or like a python dictionary format with words and it's specific definations.

- [dictionary.py](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/dictionary-algo/dictionary.py)

 This is the actual python program. There is a lot of comment in code that would put you through the codes. It is just like a tutorial-code!
