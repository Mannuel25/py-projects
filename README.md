## For your contributions to be merged;

- Put the project, codes or program in a directory(like a repo)
- Add a readme file; Explaining major things
- How to run the programs
- Neccesary links either leading to an article, a video or a documentation that is realated to the codes available
- Explain the functions of each codes available in the repo/ dir
- If neccesary add snippets of codes explaining things difficult to understand
- Writing of comments in the codes would be of real help
- Screenshots of the program output (optional)
